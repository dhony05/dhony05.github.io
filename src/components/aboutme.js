                <h1>About Me</h1>
                <p>Hey! Welcome, my name is Donelys Familia.</p>
                <p>I graduated with a bachelor degree in computer science at CUNY Lehman College in 2018.
                </p>
                <p>In college I joined great clubs/organizations like NSBE, SHPE, and GDG which helped me to be more involved in the technology field and also to make connections.Â </p>
                <p>Since I was a kid I was fascinated for technology and sciences, I wanted to know how everything works, fix it and create my own and that's why I decided to become part of this awesome field.</p>
